# What Is Loop Engineering? AI Feedback Loops | Kilo

Loop engineering is the practice of designing, operating, and improving the feedback loops that let AI coding agents plan work, change code, observe results, and revise their approach until a software task is complete. Instead of treating an AI tool as a one-shot code generator, loop engineering treats software work as an iterative system: define the goal, inspect the codebase, make a change, run validation, read the outcome, and decide what to do next.

The concept matters because modern software work is rarely solved by a single prompt. Real projects include hidden constraints, flaky tests, legacy conventions, deployment rules, product tradeoffs, and incomplete requirements. A useful AI coding workflow needs more than a model that can produce plausible code. It needs a loop that turns guesses into verified progress.

## Loop Engineering Fundamentals

Loop engineering is the discipline of structuring AI-assisted software development around repeated cycles of action and feedback. The core idea is simple: the agent should not merely answer once; it should use evidence from the codebase and validation tools to improve its next step.

A basic loop has five stages:

1.  **Intent**: the developer or system defines the target outcome.
2.  **Context**: the agent gathers relevant code, documentation, errors, logs, and constraints.
3.  **Action**: the agent edits files, runs commands, calls tools, or drafts a plan.
4.  **Observation**: the system captures test results, compiler errors, runtime output, diffs, review comments, or user feedback.
5.  **Adjustment**: the agent updates its plan and repeats the loop until the work is accepted or blocked.

This definition separates loop engineering from prompt engineering. Prompt engineering focuses on shaping the input to a model. Loop engineering focuses on shaping the full process around the model: the tools it can use, the context it sees, the validation it trusts, the stopping criteria it follows, and the way humans intervene.

The distinction matters because a strong first answer is not the same as a correct final change. In production code, the important signal often appears after the first action: a failing type check, a missing import, a broken test, a screenshot that exposes a layout issue, or a reviewer pointing out an edge case. Loop engineering makes those signals part of the system rather than treating them as after-the-fact cleanup.

Early AI coding tools were mostly autocomplete systems. They helped developers write individual lines or functions faster, while the human remained responsible for understanding the project, finding the right files, running tests, interpreting failures, and deciding the next change. AI coding agents changed that pattern by taking on more of the plan-act-verify cycle. Loop engineering exists because that added autonomy needs structure.

## How The Core Loop Works In AI Coding

The core AI coding loop turns software development into a sequence of small, observable steps. Most agentic coding workflows can be reduced to this cycle:

1.  **Plan**: break the request into concrete steps.
2.  **Search**: find the files, symbols, tests, and conventions that matter.
3.  **Modify**: make the smallest coherent code change.
4.  **Verify**: run type checks, tests, builds, linters, previews, or targeted scripts.
5.  **Repair**: use the verification output to fix mistakes.
6.  **Summarize**: explain what changed, what passed, and what remains risky.

The power is not in any single step. The power is in closing the loop. A test failure is not just an error message; it is new context. A type error is not just a blocker; it is a signal about an assumption that was wrong. A code review comment is not just feedback; it is another observation that can drive the next action.

For example, a developer might ask an agent to fix a bug where users cannot save billing settings when the company name contains an apostrophe. A weak loop guesses that the bug is SQL escaping and patches the query. A stronger loop first finds the form, API route, validation schema, and database update path. It reproduces the failure, observes whether the problem is client validation, server validation, serialization, SQL, or display logic, then changes the smallest relevant code path and runs a targeted regression test.

This is why loop engineering is useful even when the model is highly capable. A capable model can still start from an incomplete assumption. The loop gives it a way to discover that assumption, correct it, and prove the fix before the developer reviews the final diff.

Prompt engineering still plays a role inside the loop. Clear instructions improve the first plan and reduce unnecessary exploration. The difference is that loop engineering assumes the first answer may be incomplete and designs the workflow to improve from there.

| Dimension | Prompt engineering | Loop engineering |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary unit | A prompt or instruction | A repeated workflow |
| Goal | Better first response | Better final outcome |
| Feedback | Usually human evaluation | Tests, tools, diffs, logs, reviews, and humans |
| Failure mode | The model gives a weak answer | The system loops poorly, stops early, or ignores evidence |
| Best for | Isolated answers and generation | Real software tasks with uncertainty |

## What Makes A Good AI Engineering Loop

A good AI engineering loop is designed around clear goals, useful context, small actions, reliable observations, and explicit stopping rules. It is not simply "let the agent keep trying." Unbounded retries can waste time, hide bad assumptions, or create unnecessary code churn.

### Clear Objectives

The loop needs a concrete definition of success. "Improve the dashboard" is vague. "Reduce initial dashboard load time by deferring non-critical charts while keeping existing filters working" gives the agent something observable to optimize. The second version contains scope, behavior, and a constraint, so it produces a tighter feedback loop.

Strong objectives usually include:

-   the desired user-visible behavior

-   files or areas that are likely relevant
-   constraints that must not change

-   validation commands that should pass
-   tradeoffs that are acceptable

### Relevant Context

Agents need the right amount of context. Too little context leads to wrong assumptions. Too much context can drown the model in irrelevant details. Context should explain how the current project works, not merely fill the model window.

Useful context often includes:

-   nearby code and existing patterns

-   package scripts and dependency versions
-   failing test output or error traces

-   product requirements and edge cases
-   examples of similar implementations

-   coding standards and repository instructions

The loop should gather context before editing, then refresh context after important observations.

### Small Reversible Actions

The best loops favor small, reviewable changes. A small diff is easier to verify and easier to repair. Large speculative rewrites make it harder to know which assumption failed. In practice, this means asking the agent to make the smallest coherent change, run targeted validation, and expand only when the result supports it.

Small actions also protect team workflows. They reduce merge conflict risk, make pull requests easier to review, and help humans distinguish intentional product changes from incidental refactors.

### Reliable Observability

A loop is only as good as its observations. If the agent cannot run the relevant tests, see compiler output, inspect the UI, or read logs, it is operating partly blind. Good observability turns vague confidence into evidence.

Good observability includes:

-   fast targeted tests for local feedback

-   type checks and lint checks for structural issues
-   build commands for integration confidence

-   runtime logs for behavioral debugging
-   screenshots or browser checks for UI work

-   code review comments for human judgment

### Stopping Rules

Agents need to know when to stop. Without stopping rules, an agent may keep polishing, refactor unrelated code, or chase diminishing returns. Stopping rules are especially important in shared repositories where user changes, generated files, credentials, and deployment actions can create risk.

Useful stopping rules include:

-   stop when the requested behavior is implemented and validation passes

-   stop when a blocker requires missing credentials, data, or product judgment
-   stop before destructive commands unless explicitly approved

-   stop when the next step would affect unrelated user changes
-   stop when the remaining issue is outside the task scope

## Common Loop Engineering Patterns For Software Teams

Loop engineering shows up in many parts of software development because different tasks need different feedback signals. A compiler-driven migration, a runtime debugging session, and a product copy iteration all use loops, but they should not observe the same data or stop at the same point.

### Test-Driven Agent Loop

In a test-driven loop, the agent starts by reproducing a failure or writing a failing test, then changes implementation code until the test passes. This pattern works well for bug fixes, parser behavior, data transformation logic, and regression prevention because the test gives the agent a clear pass/fail signal.

The loop is:

1.  reproduce or encode the expected behavior
2.  confirm the test fails for the right reason
3.  implement the smallest fix
4.  rerun the targeted test
5.  run broader validation if needed

### Compiler-Driven Loop

Typed languages create excellent feedback loops because the compiler can identify missing fields, incompatible types, unreachable branches, and invalid API usage. An agent can make a change, run the type checker, and use the resulting errors as a precise repair list.

This loop is especially useful during migrations, dependency upgrades, and refactors. The compiler does not prove the product is correct, but it quickly catches structural mistakes that would otherwise consume review time.

### Review-Driven Loop

In a review-driven loop, human feedback becomes the observation source. A reviewer leaves comments, the agent categorizes them, makes changes where appropriate, responds to non-code feedback, and verifies the result. This pattern is useful because it keeps humans focused on judgment while the agent handles mechanical follow-through.

Review-driven loops work best when comments are treated as requirements, not suggestions to blindly apply. The agent should distinguish bugs, product questions, style preferences, and out-of-scope requests before editing.

### Runtime Debugging Loop

Some failures only appear when the application runs. In a runtime loop, the agent uses logs, stack traces, HTTP responses, browser output, or reproduction steps to narrow the cause. The key is to keep each iteration evidence-based: form a hypothesis, make a targeted change or add a targeted inspection, observe the result, and update the hypothesis.

For frontend work, the observation might be a browser screenshot, a hydration error, or responsive layout behavior. For backend work, it might be a request trace, a database constraint error, or a queue retry log.

### Product Iteration Loop

Not every loop is purely technical. Product work often requires iteration through copy, UI states, edge cases, and acceptance criteria. The agent may implement a version, compare it against design constraints, adjust the layout, and verify responsive behavior.

For marketing pages and frontend work, the loop should include semantic HTML, metadata, accessibility, responsive checks, and brand consistency.

## Loop Engineering For Development Teams

Loop engineering becomes more important as teams adopt AI agents across more workflows. Individual developers can rely on personal judgment to stop an agent or redirect it. Teams need repeatable standards so agent behavior is predictable across repositories, people, and tasks.

Strong team-level loop engineering often includes:

-   repository instructions that explain coding conventions and validation commands

-   branch and pull request rules for agent-generated changes
-   safe defaults around destructive commands and credentials

-   standard prompts for common work like bug fixes, migrations, and reviews
-   CI checks that agents and humans both trust

-   clear ownership for final product and architecture decisions

The goal is not to remove humans from engineering. The goal is to let humans spend more time on judgment, architecture, product quality, and review while agents handle more of the repetitive loop mechanics.

### Loop Engineering Risks And Failure Modes

Poorly designed loops can create real problems. The most common failure modes are predictable, and each one points back to a missing part of the loop.

### Thrashing

Thrashing happens when an agent repeatedly changes code without converging. This often means the goal is unclear, the validation signal is noisy, or the agent is editing too much at once. The fix is to narrow the objective, reduce the diff size, and use a more reliable observation source.

For example, an agent that keeps changing both frontend state management and backend validation is harder to debug than an agent that first proves where the failure occurs.

### Overfitting To Tests

An agent can make tests pass while missing the actual product requirement. This is especially common when tests are too narrow or the user-visible behavior is not checked.

The fix is to combine automated tests with requirement review and, where relevant, manual or browser-based verification.

### Context Drift

Context drift happens when the agent keeps working from stale assumptions. It may miss a user edit, ignore a new failure, or continue with a plan that no longer matches the code. The fix is to refresh context after meaningful observations and avoid treating the initial plan as sacred.

This is especially important in active branches where a human or another agent may be editing nearby files.

### Unsafe Autonomy

More autonomy is not always better. Agents that can run destructive commands, rewrite unrelated files, or push changes without review can cause serious damage.

The fix is permissioning, scoped tools, human approval for risky actions, and clear stop conditions.

## How Kilo Code Supports Loop Engineering Workflows

Kilo Code is built around the idea that AI coding should be iterative, inspectable, and flexible. It supports agent workflows that can explore a codebase, edit files, run commands, and use feedback to continue toward a verified result.

Several parts of Kilo's approach matter for loop engineering:

-   **Multiple modes**: teams can separate coding, asking, debugging, planning, and custom workflows instead of forcing every task through one behavior.

-   **Model flexibility**: different loops benefit from different models. Some tasks need deeper reasoning, while others need speed or cost efficiency. Kilo supports [500+ hosted models](https://kilo.ai/leaderboard) and local model options.
-   **Open source foundation**: developers can inspect, adapt, and extend their AI coding environment instead of relying on a black box.

-   **Team-ready controls**: organizations can combine agent workflows with centralized billing, usage visibility, role-based access, and security practices.

Those points matter because loop engineering is not only a model-quality problem. It is also a workflow-control problem. Teams need to decide which tasks require deeper reasoning, which tasks can use cheaper or faster models, which operations need approval, and which validation commands should run before a change is considered complete.

The same principle applies to cost and model selection. A long debugging loop can consume many model calls, while a quick copy edit may not need a frontier reasoning model. Model flexibility helps teams match the loop to the task instead of routing every workflow through the same cost and latency profile.

## Best Practices For Designing AI Coding Loops

The best way to introduce loop engineering is to start with small, repeatable workflows and make the feedback signal explicit. Teams do not need to redesign every engineering process at once. They can begin with bug fixes, test repair, dependency upgrades, or pull request comment resolution, then standardize the loops that work.

### Start With A Narrow Task

Ask for one coherent outcome at a time. "Add account deletion" is better than "improve settings." "Fix the failing checkout tax calculation test" is better than "debug checkout." Narrow tasks make it easier for the agent to know which files matter and which validation output is relevant.

### Tell The Agent How To Verify Work

If you know the right command, include it. If you know a specific browser path, API endpoint, or acceptance scenario, include that too. Verification instructions turn vague progress into measurable progress. They also reduce the chance that the agent stops after code generation without checking the result.

### Prefer Existing Patterns

Good loops respect the codebase. The agent should inspect nearby implementations, reuse shared components, follow existing naming, and avoid adding new abstractions unless the task needs them. This keeps the feedback loop grounded in the project rather than in generic examples.

### Keep Humans In The Judgment Seat

Agents can execute loops quickly, but humans still own product intent, risk tolerance, architecture, and final review. The strongest workflows combine agent iteration with human judgment at the right checkpoints. A good rule is to automate evidence gathering and mechanical repair while reserving product and architecture decisions for people.

### Capture Reusable Loops

When a workflow works well, turn it into a repeatable pattern. A team might define standard loops for dependency upgrades, incident fixes, PR comment resolution, UI polish, and test repair. Reusable loops reduce onboarding friction because developers do not have to reinvent prompts, validation commands, and stopping rules for every task.

### The Future Of Loop Engineering

As coding agents improve, the most important skill will not be writing the perfect one-line prompt. It will be designing reliable systems of context, action, observation, and correction.

Loop engineering is likely to become a normal part of software engineering practice. Teams will evaluate AI coding tools not only by model quality, but by how well they support safe iteration, repository awareness, validation, review, and team governance.

The best agents will not simply generate more code. They will help developers close better loops.
